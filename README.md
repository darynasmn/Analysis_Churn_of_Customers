# Analysis_Churn_of_Customers

The company "Telefonia" is in the process of establishing itself in the USA. They started by running a trial in Florida. New customers were able to use cell phones on the Teleconfia network at very low rates for one year. Not all customers stayed with Teleconfia for the whole year. The company wants to tackle the problem of customer churn with two marketing campaigns.

The first marketing campaign is aimed at cities and will involve large posters. One city counts as a small town or a district in a larger city. The four cities with the highest rate of customer churn will be selected for the marketing campaign. The second marketing campaign will focus on individual customers. 

The aim is to identify cities and customers who should be targeted with marketing campaigns. Also, my target was to find out if there are certain points from which customers should be contacted.
